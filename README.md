# 8 Sliding Puzzle
- An implementation of the board game 8-Puzzle using Python Pygame
- The goal of this project was to create the board game of 8-puzzle using artificial intelligence (AI). The board is solved using Breadth-first Search (BFS) and A* search algorithm with Manhattan Distance as part of the heuristic function.

# How to Run
- Once requirements are met, simply run python puzzle.py

- Click 'solve' button to automatically show the solution solved by the AI agent, 'shuffle' button to shuffle the board, and 'dropdown' button to change the search algorithm used.
